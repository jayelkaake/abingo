Fork of A/Bingo split testing framework.
Forked with permission from Patrick McKenzie January 2011

Goals:
(1) Rails 3 only, remove Rails 2 conditional check code
(2) Solid tests
(3) Admin dashboard with a passable "base design." Original version provided no design (CSS) for the built-in optional A/Bingo experiments dashboard.

WARNING: This fork works with Rails 3 only, do not attempt to install this plugin on a Rails 2.3.x project.
